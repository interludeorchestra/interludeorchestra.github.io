			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p>The Interlude Orchestra is a program for high school and college-aged 
			orchestral musicians who wish to engage in a large ensemble experience during 
			the summer months. </p>
			<p>This program developed directly out of the formation of the 
			Interlude Chamber Orchestra in the summer of 2018. 
			<!--The original ensemble was 
			comprised of less than fifteen musicians, and met regularly during the summer to 
			rehearse standard repertoire, which was performed in a concert in August.--> This 
			summer, the orchestra plans to expand into a larger ensemble in order to provide 
			a more inclusive experience for student musicians in the Chicago-suburban area. </p>
			<!--	-->
			<p>This summer, the Interlude Orchestra is also committed to creating an environment 
			of academic and intellectual development by providing an hour-long lecture and 
			discussion-based program every week. <!--During their time in this program, students will 
			study, analyze, and question music in its social, political, and historical contexts, 
			and will learn to connect these details to questions about modern society.--> Students will 
			learn to discuss music in a constructive and analytical manner, and will engage in music 
			making that is rich with meaning and stretches far beyond performance practice. </p>
			<p>This seasonâ€™s program, titled Things Removed, will focus on the music of Alan Hovhaness and Jean 
			Sibelius. <!--In addition, students will explore the nature of the word remove, as a concept 
			and as a physical state of being.--> </p>
