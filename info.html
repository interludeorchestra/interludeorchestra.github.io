			<h2>Member Info</h2>
            <h3>Thank you for your interest!</h3>
            <p>Below is important information regarding auditions and membership in the orchestra</p>
            <h4>Auditions:</h4>
            <p>Students who fill out the google survey will receive an email with audition materials
                specific to their instruments during the listed dates. Once these materials are received, the student
                must make a video audition and upload it to a specified google drive folder before the audition
                deadline, following the instructions outlined in the auditions page. Students who wish to audition
                for a principal position will have additional audition requirements as indicated in the auditions
                section of the website.</p>
            <h4>Membership:</h4>
            <p>Members of the Interlude Orchestra are expected to attend all rehearsals,
                discussions, lecture sessions, and performances during the summer season. A calendar is
                available on the website. Members are also required to attend additional sectional sessions every
                other week (additional sectional meetings may be added as the season progresses). Rehearsal
                length and number may be shortened as the season progresses. Any member who will miss part
                or all of a rehearsal must contact the director as soon as possible to notify them of the impending
                absence. Any member who misses more than two rehearsals must contact the director to discuss
                possible alternative work (for example, a student may be asked to have short meeting with their
                section leader during the week to work through their part). This will ensure that the orchestra is
                operating at its very best at every rehearsal. Students who know in advance that they will miss
                more than two rehearsals during the season should contact the director as soon as possible.</p>
            
            <h4>Communication:</h4>
            <p>This orchestra will primarily communicate via EMAIL. Members must check
                their email regularly after acceptance in order to stay updated on the ensembleâ€™s progress.
                Members can expect to receive emails from the director and principle player.</p>
            <h4>Principal Positions (Section leaders):</h4>
            <p>Students may elect to be considered for a principle
                position if they play violin, viola, cello, bass, horn, clarinet, and bassoon. Principal players are
                expected to contact their section with additional information from the director, and will plan and
                direct sectionals. Principal players may also be asked to complete additional work prior to the
                end of the school year. This may include working with the director to mark in appropriate
                bowings, articulation, phrasing, divisi, and breath marks. All Principal players will attend
                occasional meetings with the director to discuss the rehearsal process and opportunities for
                improvement within the orchestra.
                The principal of the Violin I section will also be the Concert Master. The Concert Master will
                work closely with the director before the end of the school year to mark in appropriate divisi and
                bowing marks for the string section. The Concert Master has the same responsibilities as the
                other Principal positions in regards to sectional planning and direction. Finally, the Concert
                
                Master will meet with the director every week to discuss rehearsals and technical, musical, or
                personal items that need to be addressed.</p>
                <p><i>*All Principal players are expected to demonstrate their ability to lead, perform, and grow
                    during every rehearsal. As leaders of their sections, Principal players must contact the director
                    well in advance if they will be absent from a rehearsal.</i></p>
                <h4>Musical Expectations:</h4>
                <p>The Interlude Orchestra must learn a substantial amount of difficult
                    music in a very short period of time. Because of this, it is expected that every member takes
                    responsibility for their own part. Accepted members will receive an email detailing our process
                    after auditions. Generally, members of this orchestra must commit to having complete technical
                    mastery of their parts by the time rehearsals begin in late June, and are expected to work on their
                    parts outside of rehearsal every week.</p>
                <h4>Rehearsals:</h4>
                <p>The Interlude Orchestra will hold two weekly rehearsals, beginning in late June and
                    continuing until our concert in the middle of August. Rehearsals will last for 90 minutes. A
                    rehearsal schedule will be sent out via email at the beginning of each week. Each rehearsal will
                    likely include a string sectional, followed by a full rehearsal with winds, brass, and percussion.
                    The director may shorten or cancel rehearsals as the season progresses.</p>
